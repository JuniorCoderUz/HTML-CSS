			<h1><b>Antoine</b> de Saint Exup√©ry - The little prince</h1>
			<p1><span class="begin__paragraph">T</span>O LEON WERTH</p1>
			<p>
				I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for
				dedicating it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best
				friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up
				understands everything, even books about children. I have a third
				reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs
				cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the
				book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were
				once children - although few of them remember it. And so I correct my
				dedication:
			</p>

			<p>TO LEON WERTH WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY</p>
			<hr />
			<h2 class="little__text">I</h2>

			<p>
				Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book,
				called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a
				picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here
				is a copy of the drawing.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the book it said:
				<span id="em">"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it.
					After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six
					months that they need for digestion."</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after
				some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first
				drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:
			</p>

			<img src="img/execirses1.0/klobouk.jpg" alt="Go to Fuck" class="photos" />

			<p>
				I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the
				drawing frightened them.
			</p>

			<p>
				But they answered:
				<span id="em">"Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa
				constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not
				able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a
				boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They
				always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked
				like this:
			</p>

			<img src="img/execirses1.0/slon.jpg" alt="I'm so sorryyy, Goooo To Fuuuck!" class="photos " />

			<p>
				The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my
				drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside,
				and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and
				grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have
				been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the
				failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups
				never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for
				children to be always and forever explaining things to them.
			</p>

			<p>
				So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I
				have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that
				geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish
				China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is
				valuable.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a
				great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence.
				I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them
				intimately, close at hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of
				them.
			</p>

			<p>
				Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I
				tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I
				have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of
				true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:
			</p>

			<p><span id="emu">"That is a hat"</span></p>

			<p>
				Then I would never talk to that <strong>person</strong>
				<b>about</b> boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would
				bring <span id="mark_s">myself</span> down to his level. I would talk
				to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the
				grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.
